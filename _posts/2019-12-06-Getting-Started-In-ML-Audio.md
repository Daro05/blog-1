Recently, after co-chairing the session on Machine Learning for Musical Acoustics along with the wonderful [Bozena Kostek](http://audioakustyka.org/head-of-laboratory/) at the [Acoustical Society of America Meeting in San Diego](https://acousticalsociety.org/program-of-178th-meeting-of-the-acoustical-society-of-america/), a student came up to me to ask for advice or resources on how to start learning machine learning for audio applications.  

And I didn't have a good answer.  Because, while there's plenty of tips out there for learning image classification or NLP, not a ton of it relates to audio.  Students have asked me this before...and so I was frustrated by my own lack of an answer, apart from "read whatever you find, try out demos, take whatever courses you can, etc."

SO!  Now, with graduate student [Ryan Miller](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ryan-miller-1aa8355a/)  (EDIT 6/1/2020: who is now gainfully employed at Creative Labs!), we compiled a list and posted it to GitHub:

## [ml-audio-start Page](https://github.com/drscotthawley/ml-audio-start)

... and soliciting contributions from the community.

EDIT 02/01/2020: We now have contributions from accomplished researchers at Google, Adobe, and others!
