The graph I get for sum of the squared error (SE) doesn't have the wiggles that his drawing on the left does. *(Perhaps he was just doodling an example of an arbitrary non-convex function, rather than the squared loss in particular?)*   Takeways at the bottom of this, re. the difference between a convex *loss function (by itself)* vs. a convex loss for a *problem* -- i.e. the individual terms are convex for either function, but the *sum* of these terms is actually not strictly convex for either function (for this problem). **\n",
